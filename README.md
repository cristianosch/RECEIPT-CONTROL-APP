## Overview

Receipt Control App is a Django-based project that helps users track their spending by scanning receipts using the [Mindee API](https://www.mindee.com/). This tool categorizes expenses and provides monthly comparisons of spending in areas like groceries, restaurants, and fuel stations.

## Features
- Upload a photo of a receipt, and the data will be automatically processed.
- Compare expenses month-over-month.
- Categorize spending by merchant type (e.g., supermarkets, restaurants, gas stations).
- Visualize spending trends with easy-to-read statistics and charts.
