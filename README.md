    Example of payment receipt and data capture

## Overview

Receipt Control App is a Django-based project that helps users track their spending by scanning receipts using the [Mindee API](https://www.mindee.com/). This tool categorizes expenses and provides monthly comparisons of spending in areas like groceries, restaurants, and fuel stations.

## Features
- Upload a photo of a receipt, and the data will be automatically processed.
- Compare expenses month-over-month.
- Categorize spending by merchant type (e.g., supermarkets, restaurants, gas stations).
- Visualize spending trends with easy-to-read statistics and charts.

## Getting Started

### üíª Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you‚Äôll need:
- Python 3.x
- Django
- A Mindee account (free tier is sufficient)
- Redis

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
    git clone https://github.com/cristianosch/receipt-control-app.git
    cd receipt-control-app

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set up your environment variables: Create a .env file in the root of your project and add your Mindee API key:

    MINDEE_API_KEY=your-mindee-api-key

5. Apply migrations: 
   
   python manage.py migrate

6. Run the development server:  

    python manage.py runserver

7. Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to start using Receipt Tracker.


## Redis and Celery Setup

To use Celery in this project, you need to have Redis installed as it acts as a message broker for Celery tasks. Here's how to get started:

**Installing Redis**

* For Ubuntu/Debian:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install redis-server

* For macOS (using Homebrew):
  
    brew install redis

* For Windows: You can use Redis for Windows or run Redis in a Docker container.

    Follow the link to download redis for windows
    https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases

   
**After installation, start the Redis server:**

    sudo service redis-server start

* You can check if Redis is running with:
   
    redis-cli ping

You should see PONG if Redis is running correctly.
    

**Get redis running**

With the project still running, open another terminal for the project and get redis working with the command

    celery -A core worker --loglevel=INFO
