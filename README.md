### Redis and Celery Setup

To use Celery in this project, you need to have Redis installed as it acts as a message broker for Celery tasks. Here's how to get started:

**Installing Redis**

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install redis-server

**For macOS (using Homebrew):**
  
    brew install redis

**For Windows: You can use Redis for Windows or run Redis in a Docker container.**

    Follow the link to download redis for windows
    https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases


**You can check if Redis is running with:**
   
    redis-cli ping

You should see PONG if Redis is running correctly.

   
**After installation, start the Redis server:**

    sudo service redis-server start

**Get redis running**

With the project still running, open another terminal for the project and get redis working with the command

    celery -A core worker --loglevel=INFO


# üß†Ô∏è Configuration

**Clone the repository:**
   
    git clone https://github.com/cristianosch/receipt-control-app.git
    cd receipt-control-app


**Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


**Install dependencies:**

    pip install -r requirements.txt

**Set up your environment variables: Create a .env file in the root of your project and add your Mindee API key:**

    MINDEE_API_KEY=your-mindee-api-key

## Edit settings.py:

**Set the SECRET_KEY:**

    SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key'  # Add a key here for your project EX. '$d6%u-0b2yym)nqvd#^jxk@ctkd2i*boz<42*kz!tbivh9&-c0'

**Comment out the ALLOWED_HOSTS line, DEBUG and CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS. Uncomment the lines for local ALLOWED_HOSTS line and DEBUG=True:**

    #ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['https://cristianodev.com']
    #DEBUG = os.getenv('DEBUG')
    #CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = []
    DEBUG = True

**In the Database section, comment the production database settings and uncomment the SQLite settings:**

    '''
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': os.getenv('ENGINE'),
            'NAME': os.getenv('NAME'),
            'USER': os.getenv('USER'),
            'PASSWORD': os.getenv('PASSWORD'),
            'HOST': os.getenv('HOST'),
            'PORT': os.getenv('PORT')
        }
    }
    '''
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }

**Comment out the STATICFILES_DIRS line.**
  
    #STATICFILES_DIRS = (os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'receipt/static'),)

**Comment out the CELERY_BROKER_URL line and uncomment the line for local Redis:**

    #CELERY_BROKER_URL = os.getenv('CELERY_BROKER_URL')
    CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'

## Update the database

**Apply migrations:**
   
    python manage.py migrate

**Run the development server:**

    python manage.py runserver localhost:8000

**Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/ to start using Receipt Tracker.**
